# Regex-UAbALL
Regular languages constitute the class of languages with less power of representation, and it is possible to develop recognition algorithms, with several applications, such as lexical analysis, animation systems, hypertexts, and hypermedia (Menezes, 2000). Regular languages can be presented by a finite automaton and a Regular Expression (REGEX).  REGEX - Regular Expressions - a sequential way to specify a regular language, through a pattern of Strings that explains the same that can be described by a finite automaton. An example, in UNIX notation of a REGEX “[A-Z] [a-z] * [] [A-Z] [A-Z]” represents a word beginning with a capital letter, followed by a space and two capital letters, in which the sequence “Porto PT” would be accepted.
